Bachelor thesis 

The first part of the paper describes the methods for face detection in the images and introduces an implemented system that uses an artificial neural network. The architecture of the system and the data set for the neural network training are also described in this chapter. This paper provides an insight into the training process of this neural network. The test results of the implemented system are presented. In the second part of the paper, face recognition methods are presented and an implemented system for face recognition is described. This chapter provides an insight into the system architecture consisting of two artificial neural networks. Data sets for training neural networks are presented and the way neural networks are trained is explained. Test results are shown at the end of the chapter. Finally, this paper presents possible applications of these systems in everyday life.
